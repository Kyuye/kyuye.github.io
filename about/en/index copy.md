## About Me

I am an interdisciplinary researcher with a dual background in Life Sciences and Computer Science, and a tech entrepreneur who has founded four startups. My work has focused on applying AI technologies to solve data-driven problems across diverse industries, with a constant emphasis on how technology can meaningfully improve human life. From emotion recognition and fire detection to viral host prediction and brain-machine interfaces, I have consistently transformed complex datasets—ranging from biological experiments to EEG signals—into practical, real-world solutions. These experiences have shaped my view of biology not as a field of passive observation, but as a system that can be intentionally designed and engineered.

My long-term goal is to integrate optogenetics, synthetic biology, and artificial intelligence to develop new tools and therapeutic approaches in neuroscience. In particular, I aim to harness AI-driven precision control technologies to gain deeper insights into and control over cells, tissues, and living systems. Within this vision, I am especially interested in biofoundries—automated, AI-powered platforms for designing, prototyping, and optimizing biological systems. I believe biofoundries will be key to accelerating the speed, scalability, and reproducibility of biological research and engineering. My aspiration is to contribute to building or advancing such infrastructures that bridge the gap between laboratory innovation and industrial or clinical application. Ultimately, I want to take an active role in the practical translation of cutting-edge science into real-world impact through commercialization, entrepreneurship, and education.
